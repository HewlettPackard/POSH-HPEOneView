         REST API to disable email alert filters.

         set(s).

         New-OVServerProfileTemplate and New-OVServerProfileAttachVolume Cmdlets.
      -- [#569] Refactored detection of duplicate JSON pattern in API response, mainly with FW baselines/SPPs.
      -- Refactored Show-OVLogicalInterconnectMacTable to return properly formatted object, instead of
         Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Internal.Format.FormatEntryData from Format-Table.

      -- Initial HPE OneView 6.00 library release.

         Set-OVInterconnectNtpConfiguration.
      -- Updated New-OVUplinkSet to ensure ImageStreamer type always sets LacpLoadBalancingMode
         to "None".
      -- Relaxed Show-OVFirmwareReport to allow supported Monitored server hardware resources in
         report collection.
      -- Fixed issue with Show-OVFirmwareReport not handling SDFlex compute partitions when attempting
         to display firmware.
      -- Enhanced Show-OVFirmwareReport to handle baselines that are associated with supported resources and are
         no longer present on the appliance.
      -- [#554] Fixed Synergy fabric module typo in New-OVLogicalInterconnectGroup for HPE Synergy
         32Gb FC module.
      -- [#556] Updated Server.format.ps1xml to display connection address when is User Assigned from using
         Show-OVServerProfileConnection.

         authentication directory is assigned a service account.
      -- [$558] Fixed ConvertTo-OVPowerShellScript not handling multiple logical interconnect group mappings,
         and IPv6 Address pools.
      -- [#561] Fixed ConvertTo-OVPowerShellScript not providing server profile connection network name variable
         in generated script code.
      -- Fixed an issue within Set-OVUplinkSet where a provided Uplink Set resource (from Get-OVUplinkSet)
         reports an incorrect category type, causing validation logic to fail.
      -- Added -Name parameter to Get-OVAddressPoolRange to assist with filtering for specific pool ranges.
      -- Added -Append parameter to Set-OVLdapGroup and Set-OVUser Cmdlets to change the behavior of changing
         the roles or scope permissions.

LONG DESCRIPTION

    This library provides HP OneView management capabilities for Windows PowerShell.
    The library can be used as either a CLI or using the core cmdlets to call from
    wrapper scripts.  The core cmdlets are:

      -- Connect-OVMgmt
      -- Send-OVRequest
      -- New-OVResource
      -- Set-OVResource
      -- Remove-OVResource

    A set of sample scripts are also provided, that show how to fully configure an
    HP OneView appliance from the ground up.
