LONG DESCRIPTION

    This library provides HP OneView management capabilities for Windows PowerShell.
    The library can be used as either a CLI or using the core cmdlets to call from
    wrapper scripts.  The core cmdlets are:

        • Connect-HPOVmgmt
        • Send-HPOVRequest
        • New-HPOVResource
        • Set-HPOVResource
        • Remove-HPOVResource

    A set of sample scripts are also provided, that show how to fully configure an
    HP OneView appliance from the ground up.
