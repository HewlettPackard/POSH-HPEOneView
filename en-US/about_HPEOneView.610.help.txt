SHORT DESCRIPTION

    PowerShell library for HPE OneView 6.10

WHAT'S NEW

   Release 6.10.2775.2226

      -- Initial HPE OneView 6.10 library release.
      -- Deprecated Invoke-OVVcmMigration as the functionality was removed from HPE OneView 5.40.
      -- [#564] Fixed Set-OVSmtpConfig to send a properly formatted request to the appliance
         REST API to disable email alert filters.
      -- Added -UseMXRecordLookup to Set-OVSmtpConfig Cmdlet to allow for DNS MX record lookup
         to be used instead of specifying an SMTP server with the -Server parameter.
      -- Enhanced Get-OVServer to return expanded server hardware inventory. This now fully populates
         the subResources property with available inventory data.
      -- [#512] Fixed Set-OVUplinkSet to add and remove associated networks when adding/removing network
         set(s).
      -- Added Windows Server 2019 and Ubuntu values for HostOStype parameter within New-OVServerProfile,
         New-OVServerProfileTemplate and New-OVServerProfileAttachVolume Cmdlets.
      -- [#569] Refactored detection of duplicate JSON pattern in API response, mainly with FW baselines/SPPs.
      -- Fixing new version branch changing default parameter values that were inadvertently being discovered
         as version string.

LONG DESCRIPTION

    This library provides HP OneView management capabilities for Windows PowerShell.
    The library can be used as either a CLI or using the core cmdlets to call from
    wrapper scripts.  The core cmdlets are:

      -- Connect-OVMgmt
      -- Send-OVRequest
      -- New-OVResource
      -- Set-OVResource
      -- Remove-OVResource

    A set of sample scripts are also provided, that show how to fully configure an
    HP OneView appliance from the ground up.
