LONG DESCRIPTION

    This library provides HP OneView management capabilities for Windows PowerShell.
    The library can be used as either a CLI or using the core cmdlets to call from
    wrapper scripts.  The core cmdlets are:

      -- Connect-HPOVmgmt
      -- Send-HPOVRequest
      -- New-HPOVResource
      -- Set-HPOVResource
      -- Remove-HPOVResource

    A set of sample scripts are also provided, that show how to fully configure an
    HP OneView appliance from the ground up.
