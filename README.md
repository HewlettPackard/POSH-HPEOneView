POSH-HPOneView
==============

This library provides a pure Windows PowerShell interface to the HPE OneView REST APIs.

 HPE OneView is a fresh approach to converged infrastructure management, inspired by the way you expect to work, with a single integrated view of your IT infrastructure.

 This PowerShell project is developed for those that want to automate tasks within HPE OneView or use PowerShell as a CLI for HPE OneView operations. To get support with the library, please use the project Issue Tracker.
